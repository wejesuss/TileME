## :information_source: About

TileMe allows you to draw with the mouse using a pre-configured set of _"colors"_ (actually a set of tile), you can draw block-by-block dynamically, save and download your drawing.

## :interrobang: Reason

The first version of this project was based on [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/IYgZMIB7_PM 'Watch the video tutorial').

I found this project very interesting, so I decided to make the original version and add other features.

## :rocket: Technologies Used

The project was developed using basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and depends a lot on the HTML tag `<canvas>` and JS to manipulate the attributes and functions of the `<canvas>`.
